- This is a simple maze game with some additional features. The player is expected to reach the end of the maze and collect the coin that's at the end of this maze. If so, player will be showed a pop-up message saying that she/he won and whether they want to play again or not.
- There is an enemy which if the player collapses, it asks a question. If the answer was correct the player can continue the game from where she/he left. If the answer was false the player has to start again.
- There are two camera views. The default camera follows the player from the bottom level. If the player wants to see the maze from the top she/he can use the SPACE key to change to the top view camera. The player can also play with the position of this camera and can zoom in or out. To change the position of this camera one should use the Y-H-G-J-T-U keys.
- To switch back to the default camera the player can press Shift+Tab
